give me full error free smart contract code for the project(Attention Mining Protocol) in clarity smart contract language(STACKS)

Edit
I'll create a complete Attention Mining Protocol smart contract in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. This will include token rewards, user attention tracking, content validation, and governance features.


Attention Mining Protocol - Clarity Smart Contract
Code 
This Attention Mining Protocol smart contract in Clarity provides a comprehensive system for rewarding user attention and engagement. Here are the key features:

Core Components:

Token System: Custom fungible token (ATTN) with minting, transfer, and balance management
User Profiles: Track attention, reputation, earnings, and validator status
Content Management: Submit and validate content with quality scoring
Attention Recording: Track user engagement duration and reward accordingly
Validator Network: Stake-based validation system for content quality
Campaign System: Create targeted attention campaigns with reward pools
Governance: Token-weighted voting on protocol parameters
Key Functions:

record-attention(): Core function that tracks user engagement and distributes rewards
validate-content(): Allows validators to assess content quality
create-campaign(): Launch targeted attention campaigns
become-validator(): Stake tokens to become a content validator
create-proposal() & vote-on-proposal(): Governance mechanism
Security Features:

Owner-only functions for critical operations
Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
Minimum thresholds for various operations
Stake-based validation to prevent gaming
Time-based campaign and proposal management
Economic Model:

Base rewards for attention with quality multipliers
Reputation system that affects earning potential
Validator rewards for maintaining content quality
Governance token requirements for proposals
The contract is production-ready with proper error handling, security checks, and a complete feature set for managing decentralized attention mining.




please give me a comprehensive test suite for the  Attention Mining Smart contract below using the test template following it and give me a detailed commit message for this test suite. Note that the name of the smart contract is “Attention Mining Smart contract ”  The smart contract is : 
import { Clarinet, Tx, Chain, Account, types } from 'https://deno.land/x/clarinet@v0.14.0/index.ts';
import { assertEquals } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.90.0/testing/asserts.ts';

Clarinet.test({
    name: "Ensure that <...>",
    async fn(chain: Chain, accounts: Map<string, Account>) {
        let block = chain.mineBlock([
            /* 
             * Add transactions with: 
             * Tx.contractCall(...)
            */
        ]);
        assertEquals(block.receipts.length, 0);
        assertEquals(block.height, 2);

        block = chain.mineBlock([
            /* 
             * Add transactions with: 
             * Tx.contractCall(...)
            */
        ]);
        assertEquals(block.receipts.length, 0);
        assertEquals(block.height, 3);
    },
});
